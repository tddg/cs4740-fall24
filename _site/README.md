# CS4740: Cloud Computing

In todayâ€™s digital age, cloud computing has fundamentally transformed
how we work, communicate, and interact. By leveraging distributed
systems, it provides flexible and scalable solutions that cater to
various computing demands, from storing vast amounts of data to
running complex applications.

This is an undergraduate-level course which explores system
perspectives of cloud computing, including key concepts and
principles in the design and development of cloud systems. This
course primarily emphasizes the perspective of system providers
rather than users. The lectures cover distributed system concepts
such as distributed communication models, synchronization,
consistency, fault tolerance, as well as introduction to influential
cloud infrastructure and frameworks. Students gain practical
experience through the study of algorithms and the project of
building distributed applications.
